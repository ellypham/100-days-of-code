# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 29, Sunday, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Committed to 100DaysOfCode

Before going on mat leave, not only was I feeling nervous about keeping my newborn alive, I was feeling anxious about taking 12-18 months off work and falling behind. My baby is now 4 months old and I'm ready to make time to brush up on my dev skills!

Maternity leave goals: Brushing up on code with #100DaysOfCode challenge. Not going to lie, after 2 years of  experience you do become rusty. If you don't use it, you lose it. I need a refresher on JS so that's what I'll do today while baby is napping.

### Day 1: March 30, Monday, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Baby napped for a 2 hrs this am and brushed through Advanced JS Objects & Functions from The Complete JS Course by @jonasschmedtman, great refresher on function constructors, prototypal inheritance, first-class functions, closures

### Day 2: March 31, Tuesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Lunch nap was semi-successful. Was able to find time to work on a simple mini project, a card matching game. Who new shuffle wasn‚Äôt a method on an array ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Used the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.

### Day 3: April 1, Wednesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Baby AM naps are only 30-45mins so its hard to dive into code. Used the time to read through @dan_abramov Just JavaScript email (and provide feedback). 1 module per nap.

If I do anything dev related, whether it be listening to a podcast, watching a bit of a code tutorial or reading a medium post. It's a win

### Day 4: April 2, Thursday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Worked on a delete feature for a Budget App:
- setup a 'delete' button event listener
- delete an item from the data
- delete the item from the UI

### Day 5: April 3, Friday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Nap times were rough today. Decided to use the time I had to work on an easy level leetcode exercise. Took me a while to solve it. Feeling the impostor syndrome today.

### Day 6: April 4, Saturday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Attempting another leetcode exercise. Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

### Day 7: April 5, Sunday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Added updatePercentage feature on my Budget App. Since you can't use forEach for node lists you have to create your own. Nice reminder of how powerful First Class Functions are.

### Day 8: April 6, Monday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Solved this one with Brute Force approach first then revised it to use Kaden's Algorithm to improve time complexity to 0(n).

### Day 9: April 7, Tuesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Solved another leetcode problem! Mental stimulation sure does feel good when 90% of your day is breastfeeding, diapers, tummy time and 'goo goos ga gas'. Its the only dev related thing I did but I count that as a win!

I'm getting the hang of using hashmaps to solve leetcode problems in order to avoid using nested for loops and improve run time.

### Day 10: April 8, Wednesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Finished @jonasschmedtman Budget App. Great vanilla JS refresher. Attempting another leetcode today on Linked Lists. Never used them before but @beiatrix has a great video that explains it well.

As a software developer with 2 years of experience and being on month 6 of mat leave, it's ok to admit that I've forgotten how to do things. I just need a bit of a refresher and I'll be back at it. That's what 100DaysOfCode and naps are for.

### Day 11: April 9, Thursday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
I solved a leetcode problem today and that's about it. The rest of my time was spent looking up resources on how to get my 5 month old to start sleeping through the night.

### Day 12: April 10, Friday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Only had time to work on a leetcode problem today and a bit of that card matching game I started last week. Better than nothing right? Woman shrugging Trying not to be too hard on myself today.

### Day 13: April 11, Saturday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Finished up the card matching game functionality. Next, gonna brush up on some Asynchronous JS so I can get started on a project where I can fetch data from an API.

### Day 14: April 12, Sunday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Brushed up on Promises, Async/Await and AJAX. Also started setup for the next project (installing node, npm and configuring webpack and babel).

### Day 15: April 13, Monday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
I gave up on leetcode exercises because it was taking up too much of my brain power. I'd rather use the time that I have to build stuff.

Building a recipe search app.

I also worked on:
- the Search Model
- Search controller
- Search view
- rendered the AJAX loading spinner
(I'm using the MVC framework)

Made an API call using Axios. I never understood the difference between Fetch api and Axios until now. Axios is readily available in all modern browsers, better error handling and it performs automatic transforms of JSON data.

### Day 16: April 14, Tuesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Recipe Search App
- implemented a search results pagination
- started building the recipe model
- made another API call to display a recipe

### Day 17: April 15, Wednesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I didn't get much done today but that's ok. I'm just a new mom trying to figure out how to keep a little human alive as well.

Continued building the recipe model. Wrote a method to parse out recipe ingredients in order to uniform the units (tsp, tbsp, cups, etc.) and remove parenthesis.

### Day 18: April 16, Thursday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Finished parsing out the ingredients and got started on the recipe view
- list of recipes are now displayed once the user make a search
- recipe displays to the page once the user clicks on a recipe

### Day 19: April 17, Friday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Spent most of my babes nap time doing laundry, cleaning and a partial workout. Was able to squeeze in just a tad bit of code today.
- worked on updating recipe servings when a user clicks on the "-" or "+"  button

### Day 20: April 18, Saturday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Built out the ingredient shopping list model for recipe search app (very similar to building a ToDo list).

And since I felt like getting into some RoR today I generated a rails application for my next project

### Day 21: April 19, Sunday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Taking a break from JS and playing around with pure CSS images.

https://codepen.io/ellypham/pen/XWmKOab

### Day 22: April 20, Monday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Last summer I was trying to work with the Marvel API but wasn't able to fetch the data. I decided to set-up a project and try it again today and was able to successfully fetch data for a searched Marvel character!

If you're planning on using the Marvel API, you need to set the referrer domain(s) on the developer portal or it wont let you access. Also if you are trying to develop this locally (by loading the file in your browser via 'file://') it won't work.

### Day 23: April 21, Tuesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Played around with some css animations and continued working on my Recipe Search App
- built out the shopping list controller
- built out the likes model
- built out the recipe likes controller

### Day 24: April 22, Wednesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Playing around with css images again. Remember that Crocodile Dentist game (when you pull the wrong tooth, it'll chomp if it's sore and send the player out of the game)?

https://codepen.io/ellypham/pen/XWmKOab

### Day 25: April 23, Thursday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Finished up the Recipe Search App tutorial by @jonasschmedtman
It was a nice refresher on all types of functions. Surprisingly, I was able to figure out a lot of them on my own while following along. Guess I didn't forget much!

Alright, I've found some inspiration on Behance and I've figured out what I'm going to do with that Marvel API data. A character search that'll display the searched character's comics and will allow user to add comics to a wish list.

### Day 26: April 24, Friday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Before I start working on my next JS project, I'm going to build a site for my sister. Did brand and design today with
@figmadesign (which I'm not very good at) so I didn't write any code (still counts though right?).

### Day 27: April 25, Saturday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Started my sisters hair website and built out the HTML. That's it, that's all I did today, just HTML, no CSS and no JS and that's OK. Because I'm also responsible for taking care of a little human 95% of the day.

Been putting a lot of pressure on myself to get a lot done (tutorials, build a project, challenges). I need to remind myself that the reason why I started #100daysofCode was to ease my way back into coding and share how I‚Äôm doing that while on mat leave with other dev moms.

I want to build all the things and get back into using JS frameworks again but I need to take a step back on focus on just one thing that I want to get better and master. And right now, that's #javascript

### Day 28: April 26, Sunday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Added CSS to my sisters hair site (desktop only) and pushed it up to git which I haven't used in a while. I feel pretty darn good about myself! Thank you hubby for daddy daycare today!

Dev mom tip: breastfeeding is a good time to squeeze a dev related blog read instead of mindfully scrolling through Instagram or Facebook

I realized that #100daysofcode has been taking some mental time from my 5 month old. What to build, what to learn next, figuring out a problem during baby playtime. Don‚Äôt let your dev mind get in the way of your time with your precious baby. They're only little once!

### Day 29: April 27, Monday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Made my sister hair site fully responsive and added a tiny bit of animation. I miss doing JS and can't wait to finish this project so I can get back to it.

You're going to find yourself wanting to learn a bunch languages and frameworks simultaneously. Just focus on 1, get really good at it before moving onto the next.

### Day 30: April 28, Tuesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Finished up sisters site and deployed it to #github for review. Oh, it's her birthday today so this site was a surprise gift.
- Added sass
- Added hamburger functionality with a tiny bit of JS

still needs some finessing on mobile but gonna wait for feedback before I make some changes.

### Day 31: April 29, Wednesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Mentored @junocollege Career Labs - Pair Programming day
- Helped students with an exercise to fetch data and display on a page
- Provided some tips and feedback on pair programming

### Day 32: April 30, Thursday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Working on my new JS project using the Marvel API:
- created search model (makes the call to the Marvel API)
- created search View (display search result on page)

I always forget how useful the debugger tool is. Use it!

### Day 33: May 1, Friday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Created the comics model, which makes a second API call to get the comics for the searched Marvel character.

My number 1 priority is my baby boy. If I can't find the time to code during the day because he's not napping, it's ok. After all, being a mom is a full-time job.

### Day 34: May 2, Saturday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Created the comics view to display the comics on the page.

My little guy barely napped today which didn‚Äôt give me much time to code today. And it‚Äôs ok! I still wrote a few lines of code before he woke up.

It‚Äôs just means more time spent with this cutie pie!

### Day 35: May 3, Sunday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Added some CSS to make it look decent while I continue working on adding more JS functionalities to it.

I'll be adding a comic reading list next!

### Day 36: May 4, Monday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Worked on a bit more of the CSS on my Comic Reads app and listened to @syntaxfm on my walk with baby today. Didn't get to any additional JS functionalities. Hopefully tomorrow.

Dev mom tip: Listen to a podcast while going for a walk with baby. I listen to
@syntaxfm @wesbos @LevelUpTuts

Great way to keep your skills fresh while on #maternityleave


### Day 37: May 5, Tuesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Afternoon nap for the baby didn't go too well today. Still managed to implement pagination for the comic list!

### Day 38: May 6, Wednesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Baby boy slept for 2 hours today! Got a lot accomplished:
- comic list model (add comics to reading list)
- comic list view

### Day 39: May 7, Thursday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Rough day with baby boy, he's so fussy these days so making time is so hard

- updated my reading list controller to delete items
- watched a video on how to methodically rip apart a codebase

Dev mom tip: Nap times aren't just for coding. Be sure to make the time to squeeze in a bit of exercise as well. I find it helps clear my mind before I get in front of my editor

### Day 40: May 8, Friday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Sleep when baby sleeps they say. I decided to code instead.

Updated reading list controller to

**Today's Progress**:
Took a break from my project and worked on and worked on a
@watchandcode
 exercise to remove jQuery from a todo app and switch it all to plain JS. I have a better understanding of 'this'.

### Day 44: May 12, Tuesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Sometimes you just gotta rest when baby naps. I did just that today. I did manage to squeeze in 30 minutes today and style some radio buttons.

### Day 45: May 13, Wednesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Installed sass, baked brownies and got started on some sourdough bread.

### Day 46: May 14, Thursday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Removed Handlebars.js from a project and watched a @watchandcode_ video on JS testing. If you really want to become better at JS, I highly recommend  @gordon_zhu @watchandcode_ courses.

Sometimes you just gotta sacrifice that coding time to make yourself some fresh sourdough!

Made my first sourdough loaf with my own starter

### Day 47: May 15, Friday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Added a loader state to my application today and that's about it.

Once baby is old enough to establish a nap schedule (4 months ish?) you can use that time to code.

AM: 45 mins
PM: 120 mins
PM: 15 mins

Don't beat yourself up if naps don't go as planned!

Attention #momsintech #momswhocode #dadswhocode future dev moms and dads.

### Day 86: June 24, Wednesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Finished implementing autocomplete feature on my Marvel comic search app.
@wesbos and @traversymedia have helpful tutorials posted on youtube on how to do this. Thanks guys!

### Day 87: June 25, Thursday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
- Review closures. I know what they are and how they work, but if someone asked me what closures are in an interview I wouldn't have known how to answer. Now I do :)
- Did a bit of css on the Marvel app to fix my loader

### Day 88: June 26, Friday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
So I didn‚Äôt quite finish implementing the autocomplete feature. Had to revisit so that when a user types and the autocomplete drops down, the user can now click on an element from the drop down as their searched input.


### Day 89: June 27, Saturday, 2020

### Day 91: June 29, Monday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Added some CSS transitions to make my app feel a bit smoother on page load, pagination, loading state and button click.

#100DaysOfCode journey has been great so far but I'm finding that I've put too much pressure on myself.

I'll go to bed late just to push up a commit when I should be going to bed early. It's a great motivator but for a new mom, it can be really draining.

### Day 92: June 30, Tuesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Implemented persistent data with localStorage.

### Day 93: July 1, Wednesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Started working on the mobile styling but that‚Äôs it. After all, it is a holiday. Happy Canada Day!

### Day 94: July 2, Thursday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Fixed the search loader transition on my Marvel project so that it would fade out nicely instead of disappear to look less jarring. I also had some time to refresh my memory on what recursion is.

### Day 95: July 3, Friday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Working on making my Marvel Comic Reads responsive. Trying out https://responsively.app to test responsive designs on target screens side-by-side. Pretty neat!

### Day 96: July 4, Saturday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Finished making Marvel Comic Reads App responsive! Now it‚Äôs time to work on making it accessible.

### Day 97: July 5, Sunday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Deployed Marvel Comic Reads! Still need to work on the A11y

First tried to deploy on GitHub but ran into problems where my page was blank. Tried heroku ran into more errors. Tried @Netlify for the first time was super simple!

### Day 98: July 6, Monday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
- Fixed autocomplete search on mobile
- Used Lighthouse to improve A11y score from 67 to 100

100 score doesn't mean it's A11y completed. Tomorrow I'll need to run through the site with a screen reader and make some fixes.

### Day 99: July 7, Tuesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Marvel Comic Reads is now accessible!

- Went through the app with the screen reader and addressed failing audits

This is a great refresher on creating temporary keyboard traps for modals and panels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoAsayPVogE&t=335s

### Day 100: July 8, Thursday, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
